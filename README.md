# HashLink

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/HaxeFoundation/GitHubPublic/_apis/build/status/HaxeFoundation.hashlink?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/HaxeFoundation/GitHubPublic/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=master)

### HashLink is a virtual machine for Haxe <https://hashlink.haxe.org>

## Building on Linux/OSX

HashLink is distributed with some graphics libraries allowing to develop various applications, you can manually disable the libraries you want to compile in Makefile.
Here's the dependencies that you install in order to compile all the libraries:

  * fmt: libpng-dev libturbojpeg-dev libvorbis-dev
  * openal: libopenal-dev
  * sdl: libsdl2-dev
  * ssl: libmbedtls-dev
  * uv: libuv1-dev

To install all dependencies on the latest **Ubuntu**, for example:

`sudo apt-get install libpng-dev libturbojpeg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev libsdl2-dev libmbedtls-dev libuv1-dev`

For 16.04, see [this note](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/issues/147).

To install all dependencies on the latest **Fedora**, for example:

`sudo dnf install libpng-devel turbojpeg-devel libvorbis-devel openal-soft-devel SDL2-devel mesa-libGLU-devel mbedtls-devel libuv-devel`

**And on OSX:**

`brew bundle` to install the dependencies listed in [Brewfile](Brewfile).

Once dependencies are installed you can simply call:

`make`

To be able to use hashlink binary with the debugger you can then call:

`sudo make codesign_osx`

To install hashlink binaries on your system you can then call:

`make install`

## Building on Windows

Open `hl.sln` using Visual Studio C++ and compile.

To build all of HashLink libraries it is required to download several additional distributions, read each library README file (in hashlink/libs/xxx/README.md) for additional information.

## Debugging

You can debug Haxe/HashLink applications by using the [Visual Studio Code Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HaxeFoundation.haxe-hl)

## Documentation

Read the [Documentation](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/wiki) on the HashLink wiki.
